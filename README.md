## Pages
Create "Pages" in your binder that store your game notes. A page might be all of the info for an NPC, Location, or the entire Session!

## Pinned Pages
pin pages so that they stay in the sidebar on the right. You might pin important information for your session so that you can access them quicker.

Edit your pages using markdown

Here's my favourite [Markdown Cheetsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) if you want to know how to make headers, links, images, or anything else with markdown
